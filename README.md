### BrewSim: A Discrete Event Simulation of a Craft Brewery

**BrewSim** is a Python-based discrete event simulation that models the operations of a craft brewery. Utilizing the `SimPy` library, this simulation captures the end-to-end brewing process, from grain inventory management to fermentation, conditioning, and sales in the taproom.

**Key Features:**
- **Customizable Beer Profiles:** Define unique beer recipes, including brew times, fermentation periods, and conditioning processes.
- **Dynamic Resource Management:** Simulate the use of kettles, fermentation tanks, and brite tanks with capacity constraints and dynamic resource allocation.
- **Inventory Management:** Track and manage grain inventory with automatic restocking to avoid production delays.
- **Sales Simulation:** Model daily sales in the taproom with customizable demand ranges and monitor inventory depletion.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Capture detailed logs of brewing operations and monitor the utilization of resources throughout the simulation.

**Use Cases:**
- **Brewing Process Optimization:** Explore different resource allocations and production schedules to maximize efficiency and output.
- **Educational Tool:** Provide insights into the complexities of brewery operations, ideal for brewing enthusiasts and students of operations research.
- **Scenario Analysis:** Test various production and sales scenarios to anticipate challenges and optimize brewery performance.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Customize your beer recipes and brewery setup in `brew_sim.py`.
4. Run the simulation with `python brew_sim.py`.
